Each change of state is reported by transmission of 8-byte packet.

ff 01 02 01 02 <button> <joystick> 00

<button> is bitwise OR of the following flags, each indicating press of the corresponding button.
    01 - start
    02 - select
    10 - cross
    04 - triangle
    08 - circle
    20 - square
Therefore button = 0 means no button is being pressed.

<joystick> byte is encodes angle and radius in the following way.

<joystick> = `aaaa arrr`

where `a`, `r` are binary digits.

`rrr` encodes radius from 0 to 7.
`aaaaa` encodes number of 15-degree steps which make current angle measured from right and counter-clockwise.
        Angle ranges from 0 to 345, therefore `aaaaa` ranges from 0 to 23 (0x00 to 0x17).
